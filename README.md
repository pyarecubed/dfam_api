# dfam_api
Data File Acquisition Manager HTTP/REST API
-------------------------------------------
This repo houses a (portable) Django REST Framework App that provides the management and control interface between a DFAM UI client and the core DFAM file processing utilities.

Portability is a low priority at present - to get things moving, this repo will house both a Django
project and an App.
